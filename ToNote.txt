Personal Notes – To Review Later
---------------------------------------------------------------
=> How we can add breakpoints in Tailwind (tailwind.config.js) / we need to rerun the frontend after each change.
=> How useEffect helps us create a timer for the “post” success message (because we can’t use the setTimeout method directly to manipulate the DOM) (Section2.js, line 75).
=> How we used hooks to fetch data from the backend and also send it using Axios, and display it on the frontend using buttons with these hooks.
=> How we created a loader in our project using the useState method, and how we used its function in the hooks and the variable in the frontend to display data (Section 1 & 2 + messagesHook.js: we use the function in the try/catch blocks and the variable to disable inputs and buttons while processing a request).
=> How the trim method helps us verify whether the sender field is empty or not.
