Frontend :
=> npm create vite@latest :
------------------------
Create a Vite project. We choose the name of the project: "." to create it in the current folder. If not, we type a name and it will create the project in a new folder with the name we chose. We choose the type of the project, which is a React project, and the programming language, which is JS or TypeScript depending on our preferences. This will install the packages that we need.  
**Explanation:** Vite sets up the project with all necessary dependencies and provides a fast development server and build setup.

=> npm i axios :
------------------------
To enable sending data between the frontend and the backend, it's a package that allows that.  
**Explanation:** Axios allows the frontend to communicate with the backend easily via HTTP requests.

=> npm i cors :
------------------------
If you want to allow requests from any origin, you can just use app.use(cors()) without any options. If we don't use the CORS middleware, the frontend will not be able to make requests to the backend if they are running on different ports, and we will get a CORS error in the browser console. We install it in the backend or the frontend depending on where we want to use it, but in this case we need to install it in the backend because we want to allow requests from the frontend to the backend.  
**Explanation:** CORS ensures the frontend can communicate safely with the backend even when running on different ports.

=> npm run <the name of the script> :
------------------------------------
We use it to run some script that we name in the JSON file of the backend/frontend. We can find the scripts in package.json or create new ones.  
Example: `npm run dev` in the backend folder runs the server, and `npm run dev` in the frontend folder runs the frontend.  
**Explanation:** Scripts automate running development servers and other tasks.

=> Install Tailwind CSS :
------------------------
Follow the steps in this guide (recommended version): https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite. Install the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension for autocompleting. You can create your own classes after learning the basics. For now, just learn how to install it in your Vite project.  
**Explanation:** Tailwind provides utility-first CSS classes that speed up styling.

=> Clean up src folder :
------------------------
In the src folder, you can delete App.css and the assets folder if you want. Leave just App.jsx (the file we will work on—delete everything and use the rfce snippet to write a clean one; install the extension for it), index.css (used to link Tailwind CSS classes with index.html, which is the main HTML page; we can change the page name here), and main.jsx (which renders App.jsx and can use modes, providers, etc.).  
**Explanation:** Simplifies the folder structure and focuses development on your main components.

Backend :
=> npm init -y :
------------------------------
This will initialize the backend folder for us.  
**Explanation:** Creates a package.json file to manage dependencies and scripts.

=> npm install express :
-----------------------------
This is a Node.js library that helps us make our server. Here in the backend folder we install the CORS package to enable sending requests from the frontend to the backend and to control if we can accept them from any ports or just the port that we choose.  
**Explanation:** Express provides an easy API for creating routes and handling requests.

=> npm install mongoose / npm install mongodb :
----------------------------------------------------
This installs the necessary packages for MongoDB and adds them to project dependencies. Mongoose allows us to connect and work with MongoDB databases, creating models and manipulating data.  
**Explanation:** Simplifies database operations and schema management.

=> npm install nodemon -D :
-------------------------------------------
This installs Nodemon as a devDependency to rerun the server automatically after every code change. To use it, make a new script such as 'dev' in package.json: `"dev": "nodemon <main-file>.js"`. Run once with `npm run dev`. The server will restart automatically whenever changes are made.  
**Explanation:** Saves time during development by avoiding manual restarts.

=> npm install dotenv :
--------------------------
This package allows us to use variables in a .env file. It can be used in the frontend or the backend depending on where you want to use them.  
**Explanation:** Keeps sensitive information like passwords or API keys out of the code and safe.
